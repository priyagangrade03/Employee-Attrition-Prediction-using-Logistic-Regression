# Employee-Attrition-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict employee attrition (whether an employee will leave the company or not) using a Logistic Regression model. The goal is to identify key factors influencing attrition and help HR teams take proactive steps to improve employee retention.

## Objectives

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns

Train and evaluate a Logistic Regression model

Interpret model coefficients to understand the impact of various features

Visualize insights and model performance

## Dataset

The dataset contains various features related to employee demographics, job role, work environment, and satisfaction levels.
Typical columns include:

Age

Gender

Department

JobSatisfaction

MonthlyIncome

YearsAtCompany

Attrition (target variable: Yes/No)

## Technologies Used

Python 3

Pandas, NumPy – for data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – for visualization

Scikit-learn – for model building and evaluation

## Visualizations

The notebook includes key visualizations such as:

Count plots and bar graphs of categorical variables

Correlation heatmap

ROC Curve

Feature coefficient visualization (coef_df showing coefficients and log odds)
